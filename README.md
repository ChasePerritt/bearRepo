# bearRepo

This is practice for the Adapter Design Pattern for the fifth classwork in CSCI 352

# Files required:

Program.cs (The main driver file, creates an instance of ToyBear, Bear, and BearAdapter)

BearAdapter.cs (The file containing the adapter from ToyBear to Bear)

ToyBear.cs (The file containing the ToyBear interface)

Bear.cs (The file containing the Bear interface)

# How to use:

1. Run the program, there are no user inputs, so it's just a matter of seeing the output.

# What's happening?

This program uses an Adapter tied to one interface to emulate the method of another. (ToyBear's hug emulates Bear's maul)
